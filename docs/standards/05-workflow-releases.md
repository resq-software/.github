# Reusable Workflow Releases

How a change to a workflow in this repo reaches the repositories that consume
it. Written because it did not, for five months.

## The failure this prevents

Consumer repos pin org workflows by commit SHA, which is correct — an
unpinned `@main` means any push here changes every repo's CI with no review.
But **Dependabot bumps a SHA pin to the SHA of the latest tag**. This repo had
no tags, so there was nothing to bump to, and Dependabot did nothing. It did
not warn; there was no error to see. Consumers sat on April and June pins
while fixes landed here on `main`.

Eight of eleven repos already had the `github-actions` ecosystem enabled and
were waiting on a target that did not exist.

## The contract

1. **Every user-visible workflow change gets a tag here.** Semver on the
   workflows as an interface: `MAJOR` for a breaking input change, `MINOR`
   for a new input or job, `PATCH` for a fix that changes no interface.
2. **Consumers pin by SHA with a trailing version comment**, the same
   convention this repo already applies to third-party actions:

   ```yaml
   uses: resq-software/.github/.github/workflows/required.yml@<sha>  # v1.2.0
   ```

   The SHA is what runs; the comment is what lets Dependabot find the next
   version.
3. **Consumers enable the `github-actions` ecosystem** in
   `.github/dependabot.yml`. Dependabot then opens a bump PR per release —
   propagation is systematic, and still reviewed.

## What is breaking

Changing an existing input's default, removing an input, renaming a job that
callers reference, or making a previously-warning check fail. Adding an input
that defaults to off is not breaking, which is why every opt-in job added
here ships `default: false`.

## Checking for drift

`org-conformance-sweep.yml` reports which repos are pinned behind the current
release. A repo more than one minor version behind is drift, not a decision.
